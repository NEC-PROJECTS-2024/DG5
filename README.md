### INTRODUCTION
Water quality is fundamental to ecosystem vitality, human health, and economic development. Contaminants such as chemicals, biological agents, and other harmful substances can degrade water quality, leading to ecosystem damage and health risks such as gastrointestinal illnesses and reproductive problems. Traditional methods of monitoring water quality are often labor-intensive, time-consuming, and cannot provide real-time data critical for urgent decision-making. Thus, predictive modeling using machine learning offers a promising alternative by enabling efficient, accurate, and scalable solutions. 
  Water quality has a direct impact on public health and the environment. Water is used for various practices, such as drinking, agriculture, and industry. Recently, development of water sports and entertainment has greatly helped to attract tourists . Among various sources of water supply, due to easy access, rivers have been used more frequently for[1] the development of human societies. Using other water resources such as groundwater and seawater sometimes assisted with problems. For example, using groundwater without suitable recharge will lead to land subsidence and using seawater is usually associated with pollution transmission. Therefore, the use of rivers has attracted attention. Several investigations related to rivers around the world have been conducted and a field of engineering named river engineering has been proposed. In river engineering, studies on morphological changes, sediment transport, water quality, and pollution transmission mechanisms are very important.
